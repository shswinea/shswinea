### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Savannah (she/her/hers) and I'm a PhD student at Northeastern University.  I'm in Dr. Steven Scyphers's [Social-Ecological Sustainability Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/scyphers/) at Northeastern's [Marine Science Center](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/).  We study coastal systems like shorelines and fisheries through a social-ecological systems (SES) perspective, and employ interdisciplinary methodologies to provide scientific knowledge geared to practically benefit coastal management.  

For my dissertation, I study human dimensions of fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico by using participatory methodologies to understand fishing behaviors and outcomes, perceptions of fisheries management, fisheries knowledge of diverse stakeholders, and adaptive capacity of coastal residents to changing coastlines.  

Thanks for stopping by!
