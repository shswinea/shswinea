### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Savannah (she/her/hers) and I'm a PhD Candidate at Northeastern University in Marine and Environmental Sciences.  I'm in Dr. Steven Scyphers's [Social-Ecological Sustainability Lab](https://scyphersresearch.wixsite.com/home).  We study coastal systems like shorelines and fisheries through a social-ecological systems (SES) perspective, and employ interdisciplinary methodologies to provide scientific knowledge geared to practically benefit coastal ecosystems and societies.  

Thanks for stopping by!
