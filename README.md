### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Savannah (she/her/hers) and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at North Carolina State University and the USGS Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center.  I study how humans and the environment interact using methods that integrate the expertise of scientists and local communities.

Thanks for stopping by!
